-- Using both ^ and $ to match across a full string
local match1 = string.match("Roblox", "^Roblox$")  -- Matches because "Roblox" is the entire string (equality)
print(match1)  --> Roblox

local match2 = string.match("I play Roblox", "^Roblox$")  -- Doesn't match because "Roblox" isn't at the beginning AND end
print(match2)  --> nil

local match3 = string.match("I play Roblox", "Roblox")  -- Matches because "Roblox" is contained within "I play Roblox"
print(match3)  --> Roblox
